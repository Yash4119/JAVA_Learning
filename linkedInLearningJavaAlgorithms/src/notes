optimizing the algorithms plays a major role in coding new algorithms as this increases the efficiency of an algorithm

example => searching using Binary Search
		   Sorting using Merge Sort
		   finding max elements from 3 numbers
		   
Best case 		||		Worst Case		|| 		Average Case

** Time complexities **

O(1)
O(log n)
O(n)
O(n^2)



## Tactics ##
1. Normalize your input
2.
